    <p>I hired Seraphim to make a short video in 2010 to showcase our clients and services. Kevin John, the videographer, created a 10 minute inspirational video that included interviews with Guild clients, family members of the clients and Guild staff. Kevin was very professional, friendly, flexible, creative, and patient throughout the video filming and production process. Kevin worked hard to produce a video that we would be happy with, and that he was proud of. The video turned out compelling and inspirational and was shown at our three fall fundraiser events last year, and then posted on our website.</p>
